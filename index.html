            Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. 
            They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. 
            Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous 
            and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within 
            lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally                 
            fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, 
            reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). 
            Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic 
            group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, 
            unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods. The traditional                 
            term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic 
            classification.
